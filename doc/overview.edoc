@title Universal Binary Format and Thrift
@doc
This is UBF-THRIFT, a framework for integrating UBF, TBF, and Thrift.
This repository depends on the ubf open source repository.

_This repository is intended for production deployment and is deployed
in carrier-grade systems._

== Quick Start Recipe

To download, build, and test the ubf_thrift application in one shot,
please follow this recipe:

------
$ mkdir working-directory-name
$ cd working-directory-name
$ git clone git://github.com/norton/ubf-thrift.git ubf_thrift
$ cd ubf_thrift
$ ./rebar get-deps
$ ./rebar clean
$ ./rebar compile
$ ./rebar eunit
------

For an alternative recipe with other "features" albeit more complex,
please read further.

== Documentation

=== Where should I start?

This README is a good first step.

The UBF User\'s Guide is the best next step.  Check out
http://norton.github.com/ubf/ubf-user-guide.en.html for further
detailed information.

Eunit tests can be found in the test/eunit directory.  These tests
illustrate a generic module that uses UBF\'s contract manager for
checking Thrift requests and responses.

=== What is UBF?

UBF is the "Universal Binary Format", designed and implemented by Joe
Armstrong.  UBF is a language for transporting and describing complex
data structures across a network.  It has three components:

- UBF(a) is a "language neutral" data transport format, roughly
  equivalent to well-formed XML.
- UBF(b) is a programming language for describing types in UBF(a) and
  protocols between clients and servers.  This layer is typically
  called the "protocol contract".  UBF(b) is roughly equivalent to
  Verified XML, XML-schemas, SOAP and WDSL.
- UBF(c) is a meta-level protocol used between a UBF client and a UBF
  server.

See http://norton.github.com/ubf for further details.

=== What is Thrift?

Thrift is a remote procedure call protocol.  See
http://incubator.apache.org/thrift/ for full details.

== To download

1. Configure your e-mail and name for Git
+
------
$ git config \--global user.email "you@example.com"
$ git config \--global user.name "Your Name"
------

2. Install Repo
+
------
$ mkdir -p ~/bin
$ wget -O - https://dl-ssl.google.com/dl/googlesource/git-repo/repo > ~/bin/repo
$ chmod a+x ~/bin/repo
------

3. Create working directory
+
------
$ mkdir working-directory-name
$ cd working-directory-name
$ repo init -u git://github.com/norton/manifests.git -m ubf-thrift-default.xml
------
+
NOTE: Your "Git" identity is needed during the init step.  Please
enter the name and email of your GitHub account if you have one.  Team
members having read-write access are recommended to use "repo init -u
git@github.com:norton/manifests.git -m ubf-thrift-default-rw.xml".
+
TIP: If you want to checkout the latest development version, please
append " -b dev" to the repo init command.

4. Download Git repositories
+
------
$ cd working-directory-name
$ repo sync
------

== To build - basic recipe

1. Get and install an erlang system http://www.erlang.org

2. Build
+
------
$ cd working-directory-name/src
$ make compile
------

3. Run the unit tests
+
------
$ cd working-directory-name/src
$ make eunit
------

== To build - optional features

A. Dialyzer Testing _basic recipe_
   1. Build Dialyzer\'s PLT _(required once)_
+
------
$ cd working-directory-name/src
$ make build-plt
------
+
TIP: Check Makefile and dialyzer\'s documentation for further
information.

   2. Dialyze with specs
+
------
$ cd working-directory-name/src
$ make dialyze
------
+
CAUTION: If you manually run dialyzer with the "-r" option, execute
"make clean compile" first to avoid finding duplicate beam files
underneath rebar\'s .eunit directory.  Check Makefile for further
information.

   3. Dialyze without specs
+
------
$ cd working-directory-name/src
$ make dialyze-nospec
------
